1,ABC News,4/8/2016,Bernie Sanders Explains Why Hillary Clinton Is Both Qualified and Unqualified to Be President,"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders explained in an interview with ABC News today how in the span of just a few days he suggested that his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was both qualified and unqualified to be president. “In a sense it’s both,” he told ABC News' Cecilia Vega while touring the neighborhood in Brooklyn where he grew up. Sanders questioned Clinton’s judgment on several key issues, including her vote in favor of the war in Iraq, what he called her “dependence” on super PACs and Wall Street money as well as her position on trade agreements like NAFTA.  “Is that person who has that kind of bad judgment qualified to be president of the United States?” Sanders asked. “Well, qualified is a broad word, but I think that judgment lapse suggests that, you know, she might not be the best president that we need.”Sanders added: “On the other hand, if you look at her resume, if you like, at her experience, this was a woman who kind of broke the mold as first lady, and I think a very good job in that respect.” Earlier today in an appearance on ABC’s “The View,” Sanders acknowledged that Clinton was “obviously” experienced enough to be president -- a departure from comments he made two days earlier at a campaign event in Pennsylvania, when he said: “She has been saying lately that she thinks that I am quote-unquote, not qualified to be president. Now, let me, let me just say in response to Secretary Clinton, I don’t believe that she is qualified.” Should she become the nominee, Sanders told Vega that he would do “everything” possible to make sure a candidate from the other side of the aisle doesn’t end up in the White House. “It would be a disaster for this country to have a Donald Trump or some other right-wing Republican in the White House,” Sanders said. The Vermont senator pledged at the outset of his campaign to stay positive. But both he and Clinton have been skirmishing with increasing frequency and intensity ahead of the April 19 New York primary. When asked by Vega if he has any regrets, Sanders said with a laugh, “It’s hard to remember. I’ve said a million things.” He added, “You know, I’m sure that I have, but there’s nothing that particularly comes to mind at this moment.”"
2,Los Angeles Times,4/8/2016,"Trump, Clinton lead the pack in California, new Field Poll shows","With just two months to go before the California’s June 7 presidential primary election, New York billionaire Donald Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lead their respective party rivals in the state, according to a new Field Poll. The survey found that Trump leads Texas Sen. Ted Cruz by 39% to 32% among likely Republican voters. Ohio Gov. John Kasich came in a distant third with 18% support. In a January Field Poll conducted before the GOP field was winnowed to three candidates, Cruz had a slight lead over Trump in California, 25% to 23%. Among likely voters in the state’s Democratic primary, Clinton leads Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, 47% to 41%, the poll found. Clinton’s support has held at that level since October, while Sanders has been on the rise. In October, just 35% of likely primary voters backed him. The polled showed that Trump had strong support -- 54% -- from Republicans who voted for Arnold Schwarzenegger for governor in 2003. Cruz appears to have strong support among Republicans in Los Angeles County. He leads Trump 40% to 29% among those voters. Despite topping the GOP field, Trump still has a serious image problem in the state. Among the likely California Republican voters surveyed, 43% said they had an unfavorable image of Trump, compared with 53% who said they view him favorably. Cruz isn’t that far behind: The poll found that 39% of likely GOP voters have an unfavorable image of him, with 54% viewing him favorably. Among likely voters in the Democratic primary, 27% said they see Clinton in an unfavorable, light compared with 70% with a favorable impression. Sanders was rated unfavorably by 16%, compared with 75% who view him favorably. The GOP holds a closed primary in California, so anyone who wants to cast a ballot for one of the party's three remaining presidential candidates must be a registered Republican. Democrats allow decline-to-state voters to participate in their presidential primary."
3,New York Times,4/8/2016,Bill Clinton Says He Regrets Showdown With Black Lives Matter Protesters,"Former President Bill Clinton said Friday that he regretted drowning out the chants of black protesters at a rally in Philadelphia the day before, when he issued an aggressive defense of his administration’s impact on black families. His reaction thrust a debate about the 1990s into the center of his wife’s presidential campaign, one that has focused heavily on issues of race and criminal justice. “I know those young people yesterday were just trying to get good television,” Mr. Clinton said Friday of the Black Lives Matter protesters who had accused him and Hillary Clinton of supporting policies that devastated black communities. “But that doesn’t mean that I was most effective in answering it.” His statement did not quiet a raging storm of criticism. Still, it was a remarkable reversal for Mr. Clinton, who occupies a singular role in his wife’s campaign as a spouse and a popular former president who can sometimes make himself into a lightning rod. He has had to campaign for his wife in an era when signature policies of his administration have been repudiated both by Mrs. Clinton and her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. None of those issues has been more central to the 2016 campaign than the 1994 crime bill, which created tougher penalties for nonviolent drug offenders, erected dozens of new prisons, banned certain types of assault weapons and sent 100,000 more police officers to American cities. Today, Black Lives Matter protesters have pointed to the effects of that legislation as contributing to the high rates of incarceration of black men and the current tensions between police officers and black communities. Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders supported the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and have had to answer to Black Lives Matter protesters at their events. Both candidates will face tough questions on racial issues next week at the Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network annual convention, less than a week before the April 19 New York primary. “I was painting crack houses saying, ‘Why isn’t anyone doing anything about it,’” Mr. Sharpton recalled of the 1990s. “But when that bill came out, we panicked because we felt it would go too far.” Indeed, most Democrats now believe that the bill, which many black leaders supported at the time, did go too far. At a convention of the N.A.A.C.P. last July, Mr. Clinton even conceded that the law he championed sent low-level criminals to prison “for way too long” and “made the problem worse.”  But on Thursday, when confronted with protesters over the issue, the former president refused to silently listen as a signature policy of his presidency was trampled upon. “I don’t know how you would characterize gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other African-American children,” an animated Mr. Clinton said, waving a finger. “Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She didn’t,” he said of Mrs. Clinton. The video and accounts of his remarks ignited a fierce backlash and came as Mrs. Clinton seeks to solidify the support of black voters, who have voted for her overwhelmingly in primary contests across the South and Midwest. In her current campaign, Mrs. Clinton has been a fierce advocate of overhauling the criminal justice system, often campaigning alongside the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Sandra Bland and others who have lost children to gun violence or clashes with the police. Last April, as protests were consuming Baltimore and Ferguson, Mo., after the deaths of black men at the hands of police officers, Mrs. Clinton devoted her first major policy speech to overturning key parts of the bill. “It’s time to end the era of mass incarceration,” she said. On Sunday, she addressed three black churches in Brooklyn alongside Nicole Bell, the fiancée of Sean Bell, who was killed in a police shooting the morning of their wedding in 2006. In both of Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaigns, Mr. Clinton has proved both her best asset and an occasional liability. He remains widely popular and Mrs. Clinton often talks about his economic achievements. “When he was president, 23 million new jobs, incomes went up for everybody, not just folks at the top,” she said on Sunday. But other parts of Mr. Clinton’s record, including his support for global trade deals, deficit reduction and deregulation of Wall Street, have haunted Mrs. Clinton, as she confronts a challenge from the left. And Mr. Clinton has, at times, been an unpredictable and disruptive presence on the campaign trail. He infuriated blacks in 2008 when, after Senator Barack Obama appeared poised for a landslide victory in South Carolina, Mr. Clinton reminded the news media that Jesse Jackson had won the state’s Democratic primary twice. He also called Mr. Obama’s position against the Iraq war “the biggest fairy tale I’ve ever seen.” This time, Mr. Clinton has a close relationship with Mrs. Clinton’s senior campaign aides and has mostly remained dutifully on message, but the incident on Thursday served as a reminder that he remains a volatile force. His clash with black protesters on Thursday also underscored the drastically different political landscape Mrs. Clinton faces from the centrist wave that swept her husband to power. When Mr. Clinton ran for president in 1992, crack cocaine was ravaging American cities and the Willie Horton ad that the elder George Bush had used in 1988 to portray Michael Dukakis as soft on crime had wounded the Democratic Party. “You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter,” Mr. Clinton said Thursday to protesters who held up signs that read “Clinton Crime Bill Destroyed Our Communities” and “Black Youth Are Not Super Predators,” a reference to a term used by Mrs. Clinton in 1996 to describe gang members and which she has said she regretted using. “Tell the truth,” Mr. Clinton told them. His reaction prompted wide criticism online. “Bill Clinton Reached Peak White Mansplain in a Face-Off Against Black Lives Matter Protesters,” read a headline in Jezebel. Salon called his response “cringe worthy.” 
“He just did to an entire generation what he did to Sister Souljah a generation ago,” Ben Jealous, a former president of the N.A.A.C.P. who is supporting Mr. Sanders, said in an interview, referring to Mr. Clinton’s forceful rebuttal of the activist and rapper in 1992 for remarks he deemed hateful. By Friday, Mr. Clinton said, “I almost want to apologize.” But Clinton allies said he should be putting into context his record and the landscape he confronted at the time. In 1993, violent crime had more than tripled in the previous three decades and law enforcement had not caught up. By the time Mr. Clinton left office, crime had dropped to a 25-year low and the homicide rate had declined by more than 40 percent, according to F.B.I. data. Median family income for African-Americans increased by 33 percent in the Clinton years, according to census data, a statistic he often cites when facing criticism of the 1996 overhaul of the welfare system. Representative James E. Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat and the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, voted for the 1994 crime bill. “There’s no question one of the biggest issues confronting the country at that time was the whole phenomenon of crack cocaine, which had precipitated tremendous anxiety through the African-American community,” Mr. Clyburn, who has endorsed Mrs. Clinton, said in an interview. But others say that the crime bill and the welfare overhaul, which cut federal spending on assistance for the poor by nearly $55 billion over six years, were done for political expediency at a time when the Democratic Party had lost five out of the last seven presidential campaigns and had to shift to the center to survive. “What Clinton did well was to stop the erosion of a certain class of Democratic voters who were fleeing to the Republicans,” said Nicholas Turner, president of the Vera Institute of Justice. “You can’t think about crime policy in this country at that time without thinking about the politics of it.” As for Mr. Clinton’s defense of the crime bill, Mr. Turner said, “I think the correct answer was simply, ‘I was wrong.’”"
4,CNN,4/8/2016,"TSA chief: More visible security, random checks outside airports","Transportation Security Administration Administrator Vice Adm. Peter Neffenger had just landed at the Brussels airport when suicide terrorists detonated bombs in the terminal last month. The attacks immediately set off a scramble by his agency to prevent the same from happening in the U.S., even as Neffenger, who was flying from Newark for meetings with aviation security European counterparts, spent hours trying to get out of the airport.
Now, U.S. authorities are increasing visible security patrols and random checks outside airports. The agency is also working to increase the use of bomb-sniffing dogs who roam public areas as a way to deter such attacks. And passengers can see some of the changes, Neffenger told CNN. ""They'll see a visible law enforcement presence in the public transit areas that will be local law enforcement, transit public safety, more explosive-sniffing dogs moving around, perhaps more random checks of the people moving through, random checks of the bags they are carrying,"" Neffenger said in an interview with CNN. For years, much of aviation security has focused on improving databases to screen ticketed passengers, to prevent terrorists from sneaking a bomb onto an airliner. But in Brussels, the terrorists didn't bother buying airline tickets. They targeted areas in the terminal that are lightly protected -- the ultimate so-called soft targets -- to deadly effect. ""There are some tactical things you have do to after Brussels, that is, you have to recognize that public areas of the world are vulnerable by definition,"" Neffenger said. ""And to the extent we can, we know the public areas of airports and transit systems provide at times attractive targets, so we've increased our presence ... and we've activated a lot of that over the last couple of years anyhow.""
Neffenger said security in public areas outside the security screening stations has always been a concern. Some airports such as Los Angeles conduct random checks of cars entering the airport, pulling over taxis to check for bombs. For the TSA, the challenge is that the agency doesn't control security checks away handled by local airport police. Nine months on the job, Neffenger says the TSA is also working to improve how it screens passengers and secures areas behind the security checkpoints. An inspector general report last year found glaring screening problems. And then there are headline-grabbing episodes, such as airport workers who allegedly were part of a gun smuggling operation at Atlanta's sprawling airport. The agency is boosting the frequency of criminal background checks for airport workers who have secured badge access to sensitive areas near aircraft. The idea, Neffenger said, is to bring the perimeter of security closer to the aircraft to reduce the so-called insider threat. That effort has taken on greater importance in the wake of an apparent terrorist bombing of a Russian airliner, which allegedly was aided by someone working at the airport. The agency is also working to deploy more dogs to screen for explosives. Neffenger says they're among the most effective ways to sniff out potential bombs. The dogs are being used to screen passengers who haven't signed up for the TSA's pre-check system, which allows passengers expedited screening if they submit to more intrusive background checks ahead of time."
5,The Wall Street Journal,4/8/2016,Bernie Sanders Will Visit the Vatican,"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders will visit the Vatican next week to discuss themes of economic and social justice that are the centerpiece of his campaign. The Vermont senator said Friday that he would participate in an April 15 conference on social, economic and environmental issues at a Vatican academic organization, stepping off the campaign trail during the crucial last days before the New York primary. Mr. Sanders said he was “moved” by the invitation and said he deeply admired Pope Francis, whom he isn’t expected to meet with on the trip. In an MSNBC interview Friday morning, he praised the pope’s efforts to “inject a sense of morality into how we do economics.” The pope has called for actions to address income inequality and has criticized American-style capitalism. The trip was announced as Mr. Sanders is looking to move past a tussle with his chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton, whom he denigrated this past week as “unqualified” for the presidency. He dialed back on those remarks Friday morning, saying “of course” Mrs. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, was qualified to be commander in chief. “On her worst day she would be an infinitely better president than either of the Republican candidates,” Mr. Sanders said on NBC, adding that the two Democratic candidates should focus on the issues instead of leveling personal attacks. Mrs. Clinton, asked Friday in Buffalo, N.Y., if Mr. Sanders was qualified to be president, affirmed that he was. “As I said, I would take him over Donald Trump and Ted Cruz any day,” she said. Mr. Sanders’s visit to the Vatican could carry a political benefit, coming just days before the primary in heavily Catholic New York. About 30% of the state’s adult population is Catholic, according to the Pew Research Center, versus about 20% of Americans overall. “I am a big, big fan of the pope,” Mr. Sanders said on MSNBC on Friday. “Obviously, there are areas where we disagree—on women’s rights or gay rights.” The contest in New York also has extra resonance for both candidates: Mrs. Clinton represented the state in the Senate for eight years before serving in the Obama administration, while Mr. Sanders was born and raised in Brooklyn. Most polls show Mrs. Clinton with a lead in New York, and she has a sizable lead in convention delegates, although Mr. Sanders’s recent primary wins have tightened that gap. Mr. Sanders is Jewish but hasn’t made religion a centerpiece of either his campaign or his political identity, speaking only occasionally about his background. “I am very proud of being Jewish, and that is an essential part of who I am as a human being,” he said at a Democratic debate earlier this year. The event at the Vatican will focus on creating an economy of “dignity, social justice and environmental sustainability,” the Sanders campaign said. Also listed on the program are Bolivian President Evo Morales and Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa. The announcement of the trip was briefly the subject of a dispute between two officials within the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, the organization hosting the event. On Friday morning, Margaret Archer, the organization’s president, told Bloomberg that Mr. Sanders had sought out the invitation to boost his campaign and accused him of a “monumental discourtesy.” The Sanders campaign said it never sought the invitation, an account confirmed by Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, who is chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences. “The initiative did not come from the senator,” he said in an interview. “He was invited like all the other participants in the conference, in a letter from me as chancellor, writing in the name of the president.” Ms. Archer couldn’t be reached for comment. The Sanders event was announced on the same day that Pope Francis urged a more lenient approach to divorced Catholics, effectively encouraging clergy to grant some divorced people Holy Communion and opening a new phase in a long-running struggle within the church over its moral teaching. “By thinking that everything is black and white, we sometimes close off the way of grace and of growth,” the pope wrote in an apostolic exhortation titled “On Love in the Family.”"
6,The New York Times,4/8/2016,Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Bring Their Battle to Brooklyn,"In Brooklyn Heights, on the 11th floor of an office building, Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign headquarters was humming on Monday. Staff members and volunteers were working the phones in spacious offices with windows that look out on the Manhattan skyline. Photos of supporters, an array of campaign buttons and a hanging gong, with the names of states she has won scribbled onto it in marker, adorned the sleekly designed space. A retired New York police officer stood guard. Two miles away, in a gritty open-floor office space in Gowanus, Brooklyn, that smelled of fresh paint, an army of mostly young Bernie Sanders supporters began gathering two weeks ago to spread his message. Last weekend, they nibbled on orange slices, perched on plastic folding chairs and sifted through mountains of newly delivered cardboard boxes filled with Bernie for President pamphlets. Visitors walked up a driveway and through a half-open side door to enter. Brooklyn, where Mr. Sanders grew up and where Mrs. Clinton established her campaign headquarters a year ago, is the center of the next political contest: the New York Democratic primary on April 19. It is a crucial one in a race — and an election year — that has been full of surprises. The state has 291 delegates, including 247 pledged delegates up for grabs. (There are also 44 superdelegates.) Even with his recent wins in Washington, Alaska, Idaho, Utah, Hawaii and Wisconsin, Mr. Sanders would need an estimated 56 percent of the remaining pledged delegates nationwide to overtake Mrs. Clinton, who maintains a lead of 219. A win for Mr. Sanders in New York would not only buoy his candidacy, but it would also be an embarrassment to the former senator from New York. Of the three million people registered to vote as Democrats in New York City, about 945,600 live in Brooklyn, meaning the borough — the most populous in the city — is home to a significant portion of the 5.8 million Democrats registered across the state. Drawing even more attention to the borough, the two campaigns, after weeks of squabbling, have agreed to a televised debate between the candidates on April 14 to be held at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The styles, staffs and settings of the two campaigns are telling, both of the Democratic race and of Brooklyn itself, a rapidly changing amalgam of affluent Park Slope professionals, newly arrived Williamsburg hipsters, longtime owners of Fort Greene brownstones, diverse Caribbean-American residents of Crown Heights and members of tight-knit Orthodox Jewish communities in Borough Park. Million-dollar condominiums are rising next door to blocks of decaying public-housing complexes; shiny new coffee shops and high-priced gyms are appearing on formerly blighted streets. While most polls show Mrs. Clinton, 68, leading in New York, the contest is proving to be emblematic of the same issues that are driving the Democratic race nationally. Mr. Sanders, the 74-year-old senator of Vermont, where he has based his campaign headquarters, hopes to make gains among voters by arguing that he formed his core ideas about income inequality while growing up the son of a Polish immigrant in Brooklyn. Yet the location of his Brooklyn field office — a far leaner operation than Mrs. Clinton’s headquarters — in a gentrifying neighborhood serves as a vivid reminder that his base of support is likely to come from new residents of the borough, many of whom are unfamiliar with the Brooklyn of his boyhood but are eager to back a more left-leaning figure. Mrs. Clinton’s connections to Brooklyn are more recent, and with her two terms as a senator from New York, they run deep. She has backing from a long list of elected officials, including, somewhat recently, Mayor Bill de Blasio, and has a network of community leaders powering her get-out-the-vote efforts, as she has in many cities. She has already begun touring Brooklyn, visiting churches and making her case as a hometown politician. “She has all the advantage,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a longtime political operative who is not affiliated with either campaign, but who has worked with Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor; Eliot Spitzer, the former New York governor; and President Bill Clinton. “Bernie’s chances are tough. Could he win it? Yes. Is it likely? No.” Many others, including Sanders supporters, agree with Mr. Sheinkopf. But Mr. Sanders has proved through a virtual tie in Iowa and his surprising victory in Michigan that he can beat the odds. On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders won 57 percent of the vote in Wisconsin. In his victory speech, the senator said that with the momentum from his victory in that state, he had “an excellent chance to win New York.” Last Sunday, Mrs. Clinton’s advantage in the borough was on display at the Christian Cultural Center in East New York, one of the largest evangelical churches in the city, which claims over 37,000 members — one of three churches she visited that day. The church is regularly visited by political leaders, particularly during election season. The Rev. A. R. Bernard, the church’s pastor, introduced Mrs. Clinton, saying that he had known her for more than 20 years and that the country needed “someone in power who knows how to manage that delicate balance between maintaining order and stability and fighting for justice and equality.” “I would be so humbled and honored to earn your support,” Mrs. Clinton said, pledging to reform the criminal justice system and focus on police killings. After she spoke, Mr. Bernard added that the country was at “a crossroads, socially and politically.” Mr. Sanders is poised to spend about $2.5 million on advertising in New York City and surrounding areas, with a lot of that money going toward winning Brooklyn, said Tad Devine, his senior campaign strategist. Mr. Devine added that Mr. Sanders planned to make several visits around the borough and hold the kind of large rallies he has staged in other states. “It’s a big place, and it’s a really progressive area in New York, so there are great target voters,” Mr. Devine said of Brooklyn. “We are going to talk about his own unique New York experience, his upbringing, the values that he learned growing up there and how that has shaped him in the course of his public career.”"
7,The Wall Street Journal,4/8/2016,Bernie Sanders’s Supporters Press Hillary Clinton’s Superdelegates to Flip,"Below the surface of the Democratic campaign, Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders are waging a fierce battle over the party leaders who play an outsize role in picking the presidential nominee, the so-called superdelegates. Mr. Sanders and his backers are trying to cut into Mrs. Clinton’s large lead in pledged delegates by prying away some of her superdelegates. Rank-and-file Sanders activists have taken it upon themselves to assist, using social media, emails and phone calls in ways that have created a backlash among the very people Mr. Sanders is hoping to win over. A California superdelegate backing Mrs. Clinton, Bob Mulholland, wrote a letter to Mr. Sanders this week saying the outreach to superdelegates from Sanders voters has gotten offensive, including calls coming late at night. Other superdelegates said they have gotten unwanted calls at work from Sanders backers, or have seen their Facebook pages flooded with warnings of political repercussions for supporting Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sanders is currently far behind among the superdelegates, most of whom get their convention votes by virtue of being elected officials and party leaders. At this point, a total of 469 superdelegates are backing Mrs. Clinton, and only 31 are supporting Mr. Sanders, according to an Associated Press tally. Another 214 have yet to express a preference. Overall, Mrs. Clinton leads the race by 1,749 delegates to Mr. Sanders’s 1,061. With candidates needing 2,383 delegates to clinch, superdelegates have considerable influence in picking the nominee by dint of their numbers and because they can change their preference at any time. Their outsize role results from efforts by the party to head off long-shot candidates and avoid such landslide defeats as Sen. George McGovern’s in 1972. enior Sanders strategist Tad Devine said Thursday that, independent of the campaign’s courtship of superdelegates, some Sanders enthusiasts have launched their own “spontaneous” effort to help the cause. “A lot of people are motivated to make the argument on behalf of Bernie,” Mr. Devine said. “We’re not encouraging them in that; we’re not organizing them,” he said, adding that “we’re not discouraging them except if we hear of someone pushing a little too hard.” One argument the Sanders campaign is making to Clinton supporters: Superdelegates in states that voted for Mr. Sanders should back his candidacy so that they are in sync with voters. Yet the Sanders campaign also said it intends to court superdelegates in states that Mrs. Clinton won. A Clinton adviser said the Sanders strategy suggests the campaign recognizes it can’t overtake her lead by any other means. “The fact that they are articulating a path that relies on trying to wrest away superdelegates that have previously committed to us shows what dire straits they’re in,” said Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon. Mrs. Clinton’s staff sends a regular email update to superdelegate supporters and arranges conference calls with senior aides. Having seen scores of superdelegates defect to then-Sen. Barack Obama’s campaign in 2008, Mrs. Clinton is eager to keep her superdelegates in the fold this time around. One pro-Clinton superdelegate said a recent email message from her campaign included the line “Feel the Math”—a play on the Sanders campaign’s signature phrase, “Feel the Bern,” and a message that she enjoys a lead that Mr. Sanders will be hard-pressed to overcome. Mr. Sanders recently tapped Paul Kirk, a former Democratic National Committee chairman, to help court superdelegates. So far, Mr. Kirk said he is targeting the group who are as yet publicly uncommitted. The overtures from grass-roots supporters are more freewheeling. Sen. Maria Cantwell is a pro-Clinton superdelegate from Washington, a state won by Mr. Sanders with 72% of the caucus voters. Her Facebook page is awash in comments from Sanders supporters asking her to abandon Mrs. Clinton for the Vermont senator. A recent post by Ms. Cantwell congratulating the University of Washington women’s basketball team for making the Final Four was greeted with comments from Sanders supporters skewering her for backing Ms. Clinton. “We are watching you, Sen. Maria Cantwell,” one person wrote. “Don’t even think about going against the majority and backing HRC [Hillary Rodham Clinton] when your state wants Bernie Sanders.” A Cantwell spokesman said she is backing Mrs. Clinton because of positions the former secretary of state has taken on issues that are helpful to the state economy. Peggy Schaffer is a superdelegate from Maine, a state also won by Mr. Sanders. A longtime Clinton supporter, she said she will back whichever candidate winds up with the most pledged delegates in the end. Ms. Schaffer said Sanders supporters have launched a full-court press in her state, using emails, phone calls, letters and tweets to get her to back Mr. Sanders. At times, it can be uncomfortable. As a state employee, Ms. Schaffer isn’t permitted to engage in political activities while on the job. But Mr. Sanders’s backers repeatedly have called her work phone and have sent letters to her office. She has asked them to stop, but some have persisted. “I wish some of them would tone it down a little,” she said. While she has been flooded with messages from Sanders supporters, Ms. Schaffer said she has heard from just one Clinton backer who urged her to “stick to her guns.”"
8,CNN,4/8/2016,Bernie Sanders' campaign manager: Hillary Clinton has 'resume for the job',"Bernie Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver said Friday that Hillary Clinton's resume qualifies her to be president but added that a person's job history is not the only factor in picking the next commander in chief. ""In a narrow sense, does she have the resume for the job? Yes,"" Weaver said when asked by CNN's John Berman and Kate Balduan on ""This Hour"" whether her resume made Clinton qualified. ""There's more than just a resume, there's judgment,"" he added. Weaver responded to criticism the Vermont senator has faced after he said Clinton was not qualified to be president. ""There are a number of substantive issues the secretary has taken positions on over the years, including supporting the war in Iraq, including taking money from big companies, that call into question whether she should be the Democratic nominee,"" Weaver told CNN. Sanders told NBC on Friday, ""I respect Hillary Clinton. We were colleagues in the Senate, and on her worst day, she would be an infinitely better president than either of the Republican candidates.""
Weaver did not apologize for the recent heightened rhetoric on the Democratic side and blamed it on the Clinton camp. ""What has been clear about this campaign is that Bernie Sanders has really set the agenda in terms of what the issues are, what the message is. But the Clinton campaign has set the tone,"" he said. Weaver cited a report by CNN's Jeff Zeleny in which a Clinton insider said the campaign's strategy in New York was going to be ""disqualify him, defeat him and reunify the party later."" ""Bernie Sanders is a son of Brooklyn. He will campaign like a Brooklynite,"" Weaver said. ""If they want to bring it on that level, we're going to certainly bring it back."" Clinton herself referenced the controversy at a campaign event in Buffalo, New York, Friday afternoon. ""You may have heard Senator Sanders say I am unqualified to be president,"" Clinton said to boos. ""Seriously, I have been called a lot of things over the years, but unqualified has not been one of them."" Clinton added that Sanders ""finally acknowledged that he doesn't really believe that"" and that the back-and-forth is ""all pretty silly."""
9,The New York Times,4/8/2016,Catholics Express Hope and Disappointment Over Pope’s Statement on Families,"Wedding invitations. Empty nesters. In vitro fertilization. Children of divorce. Pope Francis’ new 265-page manifesto, “Amoris Laetitia,” Latin for “The Joy of Love,” covers so much territory that it is going to take some time for Catholics to read and reflect on it. But they are already forming impressions. Many said they appreciated Francis’ approach of accepting families as they are, instead of insisting on some ideal of perfection. The language in the document left plenty of room for people to draw their own conclusions on the hot-button question of whether divorced and remarried Catholics can receive the sacrament of communion without having their first marriages annulled. Those who were hoping for the church to be more flexible found plenty of that in Francis’ missive. Those who were hoping for a reaffirmation of the church’s doctrine that marriage is permanent and indissoluble were also reassured by what they read. Amoris Laetitia is turning out to be a Rorschach test for Catholics. Gina Ryan of Fairfield, Conn., said she felt hopeful that Francis is working to make the church more relevant to American Catholics. Ms. Ryan, 74, said the church had been central to her life, but that she had wrestled with its positions on contraception and the rights of lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgender people. Ms. Ryan has been married three times — each ended in divorce and annulment. Her first husband, with whom she had three children, was gay and died of AIDS 15 years ago. “I feel that the marriage to my first husband and the father of my children is my only real marriage, even though he was gay,” she said. She said she felt that Francis went as far as he could in his statement. “I think doing this with such sensitive language was very wise. I think what it boils down to is relevance. Without change, I think that people are just going to give up going to church.” Archbishop Joseph E. Kurtz, of Louisville, Ky., is the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and a social worker who has been in parish ministry. “Every aspect of church ministry is going to be affected,” especially marriage preparation and support for couples once they are married, Archbishop Kurtz said in a telephone news conference. He said he expected that the exhortation would have an effect on how seminarians are trained to work with families. Archbishop Kurtz said he thought Pope Francis’ message to pastors was “don’t forget to see people as unique,” not simply as categories. “The teaching is not changing, he’s not giving new regulations or new rules, but he is giving a mind-set in which we see the person first,” the archbishop said. William Steinmetz, a divorced father of two children, said he had hoped for more from Francis. Specifically, he said, he wanted to hear that the church would “recognize families as they actually exist in all their variations.” Mr. Steinmetz, 46, grew up in Pennsylvania and served as an altar boy in his local parish. He said he began to fall away from the church after his parents divorced, but was deeply committed to a spiritual life. He has been living with another man in a civil partnership in São Paulo, Brazil, for more than 20 years, but said he did not feel very welcome in any Catholic parish. “When Francis became pope, I was very excited,” he said. “I had very high expectations, but I realize he wasn’t as open as I thought he was.” Marianne Duddy-Burke, executive director of DignityUSA, an organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Catholics, said in a statement: “Clearly, church officials, up to and including Pope Francis, still have little idea of the reality of L.G.B.T. people’s faith, lives, and family situations. This document continues to demonstrate a tragic ignorance. Many L.G.B.T. people and families have offered to share their experience with church officials, and often get a deaf ear.” The Rev. Paul Huesing is pastor of Old St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Chicago, and a member of the Paulist religious order. His congregation is ethnically diverse, with a lot of young families. For the last 35 years as a priest, he said, he has been using the approach Francis suggests in the document. He encourages people who have remarried outside the church to examine their own conscience regarding whether to take communion. “The notion is that there’s a prayerful, reflective process going on,” Father Huesing said. “It’s not just, ‘Oh I want to go to Communion again.’ You take the teachings to heart, and evaluate your marriage in light of those teachings, and make an informed decision.” He said that this approach was “very common” among priests, but that “it varies widely.”  “I think the Holy Father is affirming a very pastoral and loving attitude that every pastor should have,” Father Huesing said. Barbara Falls raised eight children, now all grown, in Old Town, Me., never used contraception and attends Mass every Sunday. She said she really appreciated the passages in the document that call the church to work harder at preventing couples from divorcing, because in her experience marriages can be saved. “I don’t care whether you’re liberal, conservative, Catholic or atheist, keeping families together is really important,” she said. Mrs. Falls, who considers herself an orthodox Catholic, says she thinks that Francis is “trying to get people back to the church, so he’s trying to make it like we’re inclusive.” But she said: “I don’t think people are interested in going. I don’t think it’s going to work.” She said she knows people who are divorced, use contraception or have had abortions, and they already go to church and take communion with little hesitation — so Francis’ effort to welcome them back is unlikely to make much difference. “If you want to go to church, you’ll go to church.”"
10,CNN,4/8/2016,Paris terror suspect Mohamed Abrini arrested in Belgium,"Is a terror suspect arrested Friday in Belgium the hat-wearing man seen in airport surveillance video moments before one of two deadly terror attacks in Brussels? That's what investigators are trying to determine after nabbing Mohamed Abrini in a police operation in the Anderlecht district of Brussels. Abrini has been tied to the terror attacks on Paris last November through surveillance video and DNA. Authorities now can question him about the Brussels airport bombing on March 22, part of the attacks that killed 32 people. Two bombers died at the airport. A third man wearing a hat is seen on video walking with them. Authorities said he fled. Investigators also are trying to determine whether a man arrested in a separate operation Friday was part of the second attack -- at a Brussels metro station -- an hour later. Osama Krayem -- also known as Naim al Hamed -- might be the second person ""present at the time of the attack at the Maelbeek subway station,"" Belgian federal prosecutor's spokesman Eric Van der Sypt said. Authorities have said Khalid El Bakraoui carried out the metro attack and Van der Sypt said that another person was seen with El Bakraoui before the subway blast. Van der Sypt said surveillance video from a mall shows the second person buying the bags used in the airport attack. Abrini, a 31-year-old Belgian-Moroccan, had been among Europe's most wanted and was considered ""armed and dangerous."" His arrest means that Belgian authorities now have at least two people, along with Salah Abdeslam, who have been directly tied to the attacks in Paris. Abrini was seen with Abdeslam at a gas station between Brussels and Paris two nights before the Paris massacre. His DNA and fingerprints were lifted from a vehicle used in the Paris attacks, spokesmen for the Belgian federal prosecutor said. ""For French investigators, this can be very big,"" said CNN's Nic Robertson. ""This gives you a much stronger position to be in to get to the truth ... to (track) other terrorists on the run down,"" Robertson said. ""And also to understand precisely what happened in Paris.""
But according to Peter Bergen, a leading terrorism expert and CNN analyst, Abrini's arrest puts pressure on Belgian authorities to find out information quickly. Days after Abdeslam was arrested, terrorists carried out twin attacks in Brussels. A senior counterterrorism official has said the 26-year-old was probably going to be part of an attack planned by the same ISIS cell. ""Hopefully, Belgian counterterrorism officials won't make the same mistake they made last time with Abdeslam,"" said Bergen, vice president of the New America public policy institute. ""They didn't ask him about what else was in the pipeline."" According to a European police cooperative known as ENFAST, video showed Abrini with Abdeslam on November 11, two days before the massacre in the French capital. The same Renault Clio that Abrini drove was used in those attacks, ENFAST reports. Abdeslam told authorities he drove a car of that same make and model to the Stade de France -- where suicide bombers detonated explosives outside a soccer game -- and abandoned it. He then wandered into the subway and allegedly ""contacted one person,"" that being Abrini, CNN's French affiliate BFMTV reported. Abrini has a criminal record of violent theft. He also had a younger brother killed while fighting for ISIS in 2014, and he was in Istanbul, Turkey, briefly last summer and possibly in Syria. Relatives have insisted Abrini was in Brussels the night of the Paris attacks. More than four months later, Belgian state broadcaster VRT reports Abrini was still in the Belgian capital -- playing a hands-on role in the terror attacks there. He is ""more than likely"" one of three men shown on surveillance video rolling luggage carts through Brussels airport, according to VRT. On Thursday, Belgian police released a series of surveillance images showing the third man leaving the airport in Zaventem, then heading west into the Brussels district of Schaerbeek, over the course of two hours following the bombings. Last month, two friends told CNN that Abrini was a regular customer at a cafe in Brussels called Les Beguines. They said he used to visit in the evenings for a drink, and described him as a tall, slim, quiet man who would keep to himself. The other identified person arrested, Krayem, has been described as ""very dangerous and probably armed"" in a bulletin circulated by French investigators to European security services hours after the Brussels attacks. A French source close to the investigation into ISIS' terror network in France and Belgium told CNN that European security agencies believe Hamed, or Krayem, had an operational role in the Brussels attack. Krayem was a resident of Malmo, Sweden, and was known to Swedish counterterrorism services and suspected to have joined ISIS in Syria, Magnus Ranstorp, a Swedish counterterrorism expert at the Swedish National Defense College, told CNN. Krayem posted images of himself from Syria with automatic weapons and the ISIS flag, Ranstorp said. The final post he made on Facebook from Syria was in January 2015, Ranstorp said. The French newspaper Le Monde reported last month that the 28-year-old's DNA was found at the apartment in Brussels' Schaerbeek district where the three airport attackers left from the morning of March 22. "
11,Newsweek,4/7/2016,BRUSSELS ATTACKS SUSPECT WORKED AT EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT,"One of the suspected suicide bombers who attacked Brussels’s main airport in blasts staged by Islamist militants last month previously worked at the European Parliament. The man, whose name has not been officially confirmed for legal reasons, had month-long summer jobs at the EU institution in 2009 and 2010, according to a spokesperson. He did not have a criminal record at the time, and proof of this was submitted to the parliament, the spokesperson added. Responsibility for the March 22 attacks, which hit the airport and a Brussels metro station and killed 32 people, was claimed by the Islamic State militant group (ISIS). In the weeks since the attacks, details have emerged about an elaborate jihadi network also linked to two atrocities in Paris in 2015. In a press conference on Wednesday, Prime Minister Charles Michel said more was being done to combat extremism, with 30 measures being introduced in Belgium including a ban on pre-paid mobile phone cards. But he also hit back at critics of the small European state, saying: ""When there is an attack like that of course that's a failure and nobody can deny this… [but] I cannot accept the idea that we're a failed state,"" according to the BBC."
12,Boston Globe,3/22/2016,"Clinton, Trump offer contrasting responses to Brussels attacks","Donald Trump called Tuesday for greater reliance on torture and border lock-downs to combat terrorism like that in Brussels, while Hillary Clinton dismissed those measures as ineffective and said “steady, strong, smart hands’’ are needed in the White House. Those sharply divergent statements from the Republican and Democratic front-runners reflect a fundamental contrast in style and policy approaches to national security. The issue is likely to grow more pressing in the wake of the Brussels bombings, which killed at least 30 and injured hundreds. At stake is not only Trump’s proposal to lift the US ban on torture, but how to combat the Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the Tuesday attacks, as well as screen immigrants from global hot spots, and conduct domestic spying, surveillance, and data-monitoring. Trump’s demand for a return to torture — “more than waterboarding’’ he said Tuesday — could violate international law and has been condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike. But it produces a gut-level appeal among his supporters, who crave a powerful, retaliatory solution to terrorism. Clinton, meanwhile, is relying on her deep government experience, tenure as secretary of state, and detailed knowledge of security matters to convey a sense of competency and calm in the face of global dangers, while implying that a Trump presidency could be unpredictable and dangerous. She said on CNN that authorities need to deploy more police to protect “soft targets’’ like the Brussels airport against suicide bombers. Clinton, on NBC’s “Today,’’ urged security officials to intensify efforts to find terrorists and prevent attacks, but said they “do not need to resort to torture.” “We have to be absolutely strong and smart and steady in how we respond,” Clinton said. “We’ve got to work this through consistent with our values.” Some political observers last fall predicted that the Paris massacre in November would slow Trump’s momentum by highlighting his lack of foreign policy experience. Instead, Trump maintained his lead in polls as he ramped up his nationalistic rhetoric against immigrants and Muslim refugees following Paris and the subsequent terror attack in San Bernardino, Calif., in December. His remarks about closing US borders, waterboarding Muslim terror suspects, and greater scrutiny of immigrants and refugees have become popular refrains at his rallies that routinely draws thousands of cheering supporters chanting “USA! USA!” On Tuesday, Trump attributed his lead in polls to his discussion of terrorism “much more than anybody else.” “We can’t be soft and weak,” Trump told NBC. “I’d be very, very tough on the borders, and I would be not allowing certain people to come into this country.” Trump said he would bring back waterboarding, a technique considered to be torture that is now banned by a UN convention ratified by the United States. “Frankly, the waterboarding, if it was up to me, and if we changed the laws or had the laws, waterboarding would be fine,’’ Trump said. “If they could expand the laws, I would do a lot more than waterboarding. You have to get the information from these people.” Analysts say it will be difficult for Trump, if he captures the nomination, to attract voters in a general election who are outside the GOP tent. “I don’t think he’s converting anyone with his rhetoric because it is so substance-less,” said Mark Mellman, a Democratic strategist. He said Clinton, on the other hand, “has strong opinions that are well grounded in facts and experience. What Trump offers is just bravado.” Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, said that Clinton responding to Trump’s policies plays into both candidates’ plans. “Hillary Clinton wants to make Donald Trump the issue of this campaign,” Luntz said. “She wants it to be a referendum on Trump. Trump doesn’t mind it being a referendum on him. “He says things that grab attention, that are very controversial. But these are scary times. It allows him to be more dramatic than what a candidate might usually be,” Luntz added. Trump spent Monday in Washington giving Republicans and the media a preview of what a Trump presidency would look like, introducing some of his foreign policy team to Washington Post editorial writers. In his meeting with the Post, Trump questioned the need for the United States’ continued involvement in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an intergovernmental military alliance headquartered in Brussels. Senator Ted Cruz, Trump’s strongest rival for the GOP nomination, slammed Trump for backing away from NATO. Cruz also invoked fear of foreigners in his response to the attacks at the Brussels airport and a subway station near the European Union headquarters. He called for an immediate halt to refugees from countries with a significant Al Qaeda or Islamic State presence and for securing the country’s southern border to prevent terrorists from infiltrating. He advocated for surveillance of Muslim neighborhoods, an idea that echoes Trump’s previous proposals to spy on mosques and make Muslims in America register and carry special identification cards. “We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized,” Cruz said. Governor John Kasich of Ohio, also running for the GOP nomination, said on Fox News Tuesday that Trump’s proposal to close the borders would not be a “wise way to proceed” and unlike his rivals for the presidency, did not blame Islam. He said the United States should lead a coalition of NATO and Arab countries to destroy the Islamic State. Bernie Sanders, who is challenging Clinton for the Democratic nomination, said in a statement that the Brussels attack served as a “brutal reminder that the international community must come together to destroy ISIS.”"
13,The Washington Post,4/6/2016,Donald Trump thinks more countries should have nuclear weapons. Here’s what the research says.,"According to Donald Trump, the United States should not try so hard to stop nuclear proliferation. On Sunday night, during a Republican town hall hosted by CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Trump declared that proliferation is “going to happen anyway.” And just a week earlier, Trump told the New York Times, “If Japan had that nuclear threat, I’m not sure that would be a bad thing for us.” Nor would it be so bad, he’s said, if South Korea and Saudi Arabia had nuclear weapons, too. We can break down Trump’s assertions into two ideas: Proliferation is inevitable, and it is good for the United States — at least when its allies are the ones going nuclear. What can political science tell us about each of these beliefs? It turns out that both propositions fly in the face of a wide range of recent scholarship. Is nuclear proliferation inevitable? Trump’s logic for this idea is based on his belief that the United States is weak and that past proliferation ensures future proliferation. Here’s what Trump told the Times about Japan: “If the United States keeps on … its current path of weakness, [Japan is] going to want to have [nuclear weapons] anyway with or without me discussing it.” Trump also implied that South Korea and Japan would inexorably seek nuclear weapons — regardless of what the United States does — because so many countries have already gone nuclear. As he said to Anderson Cooper: “It’s only a question of time. … You have so many [nuclear] countries already.” But as we show in a number of research articles, those assumptions don’t match the historical record. For the past 70 years, through mutually reinforcing policies — including security guarantees, troop deployments, arms sales, nuclear umbrellas and sanctions threats — U.S. administrations from both parties have inhibited nuclear proliferation. When another country built nuclear weapons, the United States limited the repercussions by discouraging that country from conducting nuclear tests. What about Trump’s belief that U.S. allies will inevitably seek nuclear weapons because the United States is economically and militarily weak? That doesn’t match the facts, either. The United States remains the world’s dominant military power — it spends three to four times as much on its military than China does, and it has the world’s most advanced nuclear arsenal. The United States also has a dynamic and growing economy, while its rivals’ economies are slowing or even declining. But even when the U.S. economy was flagging, the government successfully prevented other countries from acquiring nuclear arms. The 1970s were a period of high inflation and low economic growth in the United States. Yet that’s when Washington launched some of its most determined and successful nonproliferation efforts, including founding the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group, a global body that restricts the spread of sensitive nuclear technology, and passing laws that imposed mandatory nonproliferation sanctions, which have successfully deterred other countries from embarking on nuclear weapons programs. Although history suggests that proliferation is not inevitable, recent research on nonproliferation suggests that Trump’s proposed foreign policy might make it so. Trump says he would scale back or entirely end U.S. alliance commitments unless our allies made major financial concessions. In his interview with the Times, Trump said that the United States “take[s] tremendous monetary hits on protecting countries” such as Japan, South Korea, Germany and Saudi Arabia. He also denounced the U.S.-Japan Mutual Security Treaty as “one-sided,” said that the United States doesn’t need to maintain forces in South Korea and described the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as “obsolete.” But if those security institutions and military deployments disappeared, U.S. allies — including Japan and South Korea — might well pursue nuclear weapons of their own. Recent research shows that alliances are a powerful tool for preventing proliferation, both because they reassure states that their security will be protected in case of attack and because they give senior partners the leverage to restrain their allies’ nuclear ambitions. Research also demonstrates that the type of U.S. troop withdrawals Trump envisions have a history of prompting allies to consider developing their own nuclear weapons. Consider the last time the United States had a president who was skeptical about nonproliferation and who tried to reduce U.S. commitments to its allies in Asia. As part of his Guam Doctrine — a plan to increase Asian allies’ military self-reliance — President Nixon withdrew 20,000 troops from South Korea. Famously, he also traveled to China to improve Sino-American relations. As a result, South Korea launched a covert nuclear weapons program, and Taiwan ramped up its own nuclear ambitions. So why didn’t they end up with nuclear weapons? The administrations that followed Nixon’s redoubled efforts to stop them. Research does not support the idea that the spread of nuclear weapons is inevitable. But isolationist “America First” policies could prompt that spread. Defining U.S. strategic interests primarily in terms of monetary gain, and curtailing U.S. global engagement toward that end, would boost the probability that our allies would respond by going nuclear. Would nuclear proliferation be good for U.S. interests? What about Trump’s second proposition: that proliferation by our allies would be good for U.S. interests? This argument is based on the idea that nuclear-armed allies could help contain U.S. adversaries and enable the United States to save money. As Trump told Cooper, “I would rather see Japan having some form of defense, and maybe even offense, against North Korea.” And as he suggested, the United States can’t afford to protect Japan and South Korea — and therefore, “they have to pay us or we have to let them protect themselves.” Reducing military commitments and letting allies build their own nuclear weapons might save money for the United States. But international relations scholarship suggests that allied proliferation would have broader negative repercussions. Among these would be declining U.S. influence. When nations gain their own military capabilities, they rely less on their allies and become less subject to their sway. And that can undermine a senior partner’s ability to hold its junior allies back from risky military actions. In other words, allowing or encouraging proliferation would worsen the “American weakness” that Trump decries. Recent nonproliferation research underscores this proposition. Mark Bell shows that nuclear allies are likely to become more independent of their patrons and in some cases can develop more assertive foreign policies. And Francis Gavin and Matthew Kroenig show that the fear of declining influence was one reason why most American administrations vigorously opposed the spread of nuclear weapons. Nuclear allies can also become security risks. Vipin Narang demonstrates that when weaker states gain nuclear weapons, they often seek to coerce their senior partners into intervening on their behalf by threatening to use nuclear weapons. That’s what Israel did at the height of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. That’s what South Africa did during its 1988 confrontation with Cuban forces in Angola. And that’s what Pakistan did in the midst of its 1990 military crisis with India. Instead of relieving the United States of a military burden, as Donald Trump suggests, having more nuclear allies could increase the risk that the United States would get involved in conflicts that might turn nuclear. Furthermore, were South Korea or Japan to begin developing nuclear weapons, their rivals might be tempted to launch preventive military strikes, which research suggests has been frequently considered in the past. The road to nuclear acquisition is often rocky and increases the likelihood of militarized conflict. For example, Soviet worries that West Germany would acquire nuclear weapons helped trigger the Berlin Crisis. And if Japan or South Korea actually acquired nuclear weapons, we could possibly see a nuclear arms race in Asia. Japan’s neighbors, including South Korea, would fear resurgent Japanese militarism. North Korea would expand its nuclear capabilities. China would continue to expand its own nuclear arsenal. Why haven’t we seen nuclear arms races before? Nuclear “domino effects” have not been common historically. But that’s largely because of determined U.S. efforts to stop them. Since the dawn of the nuclear age, the United States has pursued nonproliferation as a top policy priority. That includes sponsoring and enforcing the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Research suggests the NPT has been instrumental in limiting the spread of nuclear weapons, in part by coordinating states’ beliefs about one another’s nonproliferation commitments. To develop nuclear weapons, Japan and South Korea would need to violate or withdraw from the NPT. That could prompt U.S. allies and adversaries in other regions — including Saudi Arabia, Germany and Iran — to question the treaty’s viability and consider seeking their own nuclear arsenals. Would this be so bad? After all, no two nuclear armed states have fought a major war with each other, and nuclear weapons have not been used in conflict since the United States bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. But the conclusion that nuclear weapons produce peace is subject to debate. It’s true that there has been no war between major powers since 1945. But that may be due to other factors. The quantitative evidence linking nuclear weapons to a reduced risk of conflict is limited at best. Further, theoretical and historical evidence suggests that nuclear accidents and miscalculations are likely. More countries with nuclear weapons would mean more opportunities for catastrophic nuclear mistakes. A look at history shows us that nuclear proliferation is anything but inevitable. U.S. nonproliferation efforts have been surprisingly successful, even when the United States was weaker than it is today. Without firm U.S. opposition to the spread of nuclear weapons — a policy implemented through “carrots” like alliances and “sticks” like sanctions — the world would probably have far more than nine countries with nuclear weapons. What’s more, research suggests that nuclear proliferation would reduce U.S. world influence, undermine global stability and increase the risk of nuclear war."

The front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination stunned two of America's strongest allies with the suggestion that the U.S. military would be withdrawn from their shores, with nuclear weapons replacing them. There are currently 54,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan and 28,500 in South Korea. ""Japan is better if it protects itself against this maniac of North Korea,"" Trump told CNN's Anderson Cooper Tuesday. ""We are better off frankly if South Korea is going to start protecting itself ... they have to protect themselves or they have to pay us."" So high was the level of concern, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe felt the need to respond publicly, saying, ""whoever will become the next president of the United States, the Japan-U.S. alliance is the cornerstone of Japan's diplomacy.""

Academic Cheong Seong-Chang from the non-profit think-tank the Sejong Institute said, ""If we have nuclear weapons, we'll be in a much better position to deal with North Korea."" But his feeling is not mainstream. Government reaction has been more focused on Trump's assertion that South Korea is not paying its way. Trump told CNN's Wolf Blitzer earlier this year, ""South Korea is a money machine but they pay us peanuts ... South Korea should pay us very substantially for protecting them."" Howls of inaccuracy came from the South Korean Foreign Ministry, the U.S. ambassador to South Korea, and even the White House. Ambassador Mark Lippert said Seoul pays for 55% of all non-personnel costs. And former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Christopher Hill was more succinct. He told CNN, ""I don't know what he's talking about but clearly neither does he."" Newspaper editorials and experts alike have taken aim at Trump's comments about introducing more nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula to counter the North Korean threat. Daniel Pinkston of Troy University said it would play into North Korea's hands. ""The hardliners in Pyongyang would just love such an outcome because if that were to occur, it would completely justify their nuclear status ... and validate Kim Jong Un's policy line as absolutely brilliant and absolutely correct,"" he said. Reflecting a growing concern, Pinkston added, ""Whether he wins the Republican nomination or not, or whether he is elected president or not, even at this stage, he is already doing damage to the U.S. reputation internationally. And damaging U.S. security interests.""

15,BBC,4/7/2016,US election: Could Trump really cut the US $19tn debt in eight years?,"Donald Trump's policy proposals have generated a lot of headlines over the course of his presidential campaign. But none has made economists shriek more than the Republican front-runner's suggestion that he could eliminate US government debt in eight years. Official US public debt is over $19tn (£13.4tn) - this accounts for the amount of money the government has borrowed through treasury and saving bonds. Since the US government is borrowing more than it brings in through taxes in order to pay its bills - including the servicing of this debt- it is running on a deficit. Economists argue over this figure, saying the debt level could be much higher, if the government included the money it owes itself for running federal programmes. To eliminate the public debt in eight years, a potential President Trump would need to come up with an extra $2.4tn a year either through spending cuts or tax increases. Trump campaign spokesman Barry Bennett said the debt could be wiped by selling government assets, including government buildings, land and energy resources. He claims this could bring in $16tn. According to the US Government Accountability Office, though, the federal government only owns $3.1tn in assets. This does not include natural resources or stewardship assets. To get close to Mr Bennett's figure, Americans would have to give up all their national parks, and sell the natural resources on public land including timber and minerals. The country would also have to sell energy reserves like offshore oil and hope the price of that oil - which has fallen over 70% since June 2014 - starts rising. Deficit hawks, who have decried politicians for ignoring the country's ever mounting debt burden, rose up to point out that although the US needs to address this problem, Mr Trump's overall economic plan on tax and spending would actually take the country in the opposite direction.

""If he does what he proposes to do, in eight years the fiscal gap will be even bigger,"" say Laurence Kotlikoff, professor of economics at Boston University. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget - a cross-party group - Mr Trump's economic plan would double the national debt, with it growing naturally to a $28tn deficit by 2026, plus another $10tn from the spending and tax cuts Mr Trump has proposed.

Mr Trump has put forward a tax plan that would charge individuals between 0% and 25% tax based on income and cut the corporate tax rate in half to 15%. He has said this will lead to economic growth as more companies open in the US and individuals spend more money they don't have to give to the taxman. Mr Trump claims his plan will not add to the national deficit because cuts will be offset by closing tax loopholes. But economists predict his tax plan could reduce the money coming into the federal government by between $9.5tn and $12tn. ""With Trump's tax plan there is no way we could get to a balanced budget in eight years,"" says Ron Haskins from Brookings Institute. All economists agree that, to get the US budget balanced, some harsh spending cuts would be required. But according to the CRFB, under Mr Trump's proposed plan, 96% of government spending would need to be eliminated. The outspoken candidate has ruled out any cuts to Social Security - the government pension programme. It accounts for the largest portion of US government spending. He has pledged to reduce the cost of Medicaid - the government sponsored healthcare programme and the US government's second largest expense - by $300bn through reduced prescription drug costs. The US public as a whole, including Medicaid, spent just over that amount - $374bn- on prescription drugs in 2015. For Mr Trump to save that amount of money he would need to reduce Medicaid's drug bill to zero. Mr Trump has also said he would save money by lowering the number of people on Medicaid by creating more jobs. But most recipients of the government healthcare programme are already employed in low-paying jobs. Like many other politicians, Mr Trump has said his administration would cut waste and fraud, saving the US government billions. Most economists agree this is necessary, but waste and fraud make up such a small percentage of the national debt that this alone could never lead to a balanced budget. The real key to Mr Trump's plan seems to be boosting the economy, which he has promised to accomplish by renegotiating trade deals. On his campaign website though, he lists cutting the debt as integral to that negotiation process. ""Closing the deficit and reducing our debt will mean China cannot blackmail us with our own Treasury bond,"" the website says. It's unclear which comes first - cutting the debt to boost the US position in trade negotiations or renegotiating to boost the economy and bring down the debt. According to Mr Haskins, boosting the economy is one way to cut the deficit but ""it would require an unprecedented amount of growth"" - perhaps as high as 20%. That is assuming, too, that Mr Trump's insistence on renegotiating trade deals does not lead to a trade war and a decline in the US economy, as some economists have suggested might happen. All told, it is unlikely that any of the plans Mr Trump has proposed will cut the national debt, according to experts. They would more likely increase it. "
